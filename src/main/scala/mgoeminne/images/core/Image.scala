/**
  * A generic representation of an image.
  *
  * Each type of image has 3 distinct representations:
  *
  * - An internal representation that optimizes memory and CPU consumption. Details about this representation
  * are hidden.
  * - A specific representation, that associates each pixel to a Scala variable, depending on the nature of the pixels.
  *   - Binary image pixels are represented by a [[scala.Boolean]].
  *   - Greyscale image pixels are represented by a [[scala.Byte]], having a value between [[scala.Byte.MinValue]] and [[scala.Byte.MaxValue]].
  *   - RGB image pixels are represented by a [[java.awt.Color]].
  * - A generic representation, that associates each pixel to a [[scala.Int]]. This allows the user to manipulate any kind
  * of pixel, regardless the actual image representation.
  *
  *
  * @tparam T the type of concrete image.
  * @tparam R the type of object used for the specific representation of the pixels contained in this image.
